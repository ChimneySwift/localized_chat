# Localized Chat
Minetest mod that makes it easy to chat to nearby players

Add `[` to the front of your chat messages to send the messages to players within the chat_range radius (default is 50 nodes, can be changed by changing `chat_range` in minetest.conf)

Players with the `kick` privilage will recieve local chat regardless of their proximity to the sender.
